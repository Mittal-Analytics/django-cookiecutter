# CookieCutter template for our Django projects

CookieCutter allows us to create project templates. It is useful to automate the setup.


## Problem

Starting new projects
is a problem for me
because it requires a lot of copy-pasting from exiting projects.

It leads to lot of code-duplication. The best practices are spread all over the projects. Typically, a good change should flow to other projects as well.


### There are other CookieCutter templates. Why create another one?

To focus on:
- Editorconfig
- Editor defaults
- Better READMEs
- Deployment automation


## How to use this?

To be done.

## How to contribute?

Setup the local env:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
